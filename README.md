# Minesweeper App (in progress)

An minesweeper game developed in HTML and JS as a personal project.

## To Do:

-   add scripts for what happens on click
-   add possibility for user to mark squares for mines
-   add ability to change number of mines that appear via a text box

## Styling and Design

Since the majority of minesweeper games I could find used the same pale greys and bright reds and blues, I decided to change it up a bit and make the page more pastel, so that it would stand out among the other minesweeper games.

The only bright colour should be the background as pastel backgrounds tend to feel somewhat dated to me.
